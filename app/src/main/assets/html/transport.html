									<p><strong>Jakdojade</strong></br>If you’re heading to Poland for the first time and a little concerned about how to get from Point A to Point B on public transport then you need to down a free app, jakdojade.pl. The jakdojade.pl app is an awesome public transport app which provides detailed directions for the majority of cities in Poland. It is so easy to use that it became the one app that we relied upon daily to get us to the next destination.</p>

									<p><strong>NextBike</strong></br>Bicycle users are normally obtained through a subscription system, where each bike is locked to either itself or to a rental station. If using a stand-alone lock, the bike is rented via a mobile phone call or the mobile app, which provides the locking code. The bikes can be returned via app, hotline, terminal or board computer. There are cities with a flex zone allowing users to return the bike anywhere within a defined area for a small additional fee.</p>

Riders must choose a payment method: cash, credit card or mobile carrier billing before they can use the service. The customer requests a ride and confirms their pick-up location. Once the driver accepts the trip, the customer will be able to see the driver's name and car details. After the ride is completed both driver and the rider can rate each other.</p>

									<p><strong>FreeNow</strong></br>The Free Now app uses mobile and GPS technology to match taxi drivers with passengers based on availability and proximity, and requires a valid phone number and valid form of payment (debit or credit card, Apple Pay, Google Wallet or PayPal) to operate. The Free Now app is compatible with both iOS and Android mobile devices, and works with licensed taxis, including black cabs in the UK. Depending on location, customers can order a taxi, E-scooter or car through the app.</p>
